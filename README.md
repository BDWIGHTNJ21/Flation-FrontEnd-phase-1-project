My Flatiron Frontend Phase 1 Project
A README:

This App was created to help Amazon Operation Dept. manage deployed equipment. The App will keep track of deployed equipment and the assigned user until item returns. 

How it works:

Ops will input user login and deployed equipment id in the input fileds. Data is stored until item is marked returned. 


At the end of each shift, Ops will scan the returned equimpment in the "Returned Equipment field"
 
 All items that haven't been returned will renmain marked as "Deployed" until scanned as returned
